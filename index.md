# vakaruge

one day some techies sat down for a coffee and semi-agreed that we as a community is too stagnant and is not doing much. with the opposing dilemmas of "everyone is too busy" and "want to contribute to the society", we decided to meet in the middle. that is, create something that everyone can get on in, that doesn't take too much time or effort, but still be engaged as a community and makes friends along the way.

## ongoing/upcoming events
\*events will be linked here as they become available\*

## what it is about
we are going to host various activities and games that techs of different fields in the tech community can take part in at their own pace. at the end of each activity, a winner will be chosen and given a sweet reward. but why do something like this? we realized there are multiple reasons, including but not limited to
- making people engage more as a community
- motivate collaboration between us
- encourage touching grass, go out and meet physically once a while
- promote some healthy competition
- get rewarded for inspiring work

## what sort of activities
since everyone has a busy IRL schedule, we decided that the activities and games carried out will be relatively non-cumbersome. things that can be done during free time or on breaks during or after office hours. and also provide plenty of time to complete them so that you are not overwhelmed by rapid deadlines. we thought of various such things like
- mini hackathon-type events (but with twists)
- creating proposals for interesting projects
- CTF-type hacking events
- games and gamified things
- scavenger hunts
- and more as we move forward

## get involved
you can participate in events as they get announced. these announcements will be posted on large Maldivian tech community groups such as MV Devs, WITMV, ICT Maldives.
you can also help us create and organize new events simply by reaching out to us. if you have other creative community collaboration activity ideas, don't hesitate to pitch it.
for those in a generous mood, adding to the reward pool, of course, will be awe inspiring for the rest of us.

## regarding vakaruge
as said before, this is not a strictly business platform. rather, this is just a place for us tech community to gather, exchange ideas, participate in activities and have fun in the process. there are no strict participation requirements and guidelines. what we are doing is not for making a huge impact. rather, it is for making friends, having a coffee and doing things we always loved doing.
having said that, we are also hoping that with initiatives such as this, as a side effect, will hopefully bolster the tech community and the tech industry as a whole. we believe that there is simply not enough social interactions and engagement between us tech folks in Maldives. turning it around would be a win-win situation for all parties involved - for finding like-minded people, for employers and employees, and for us who is in it for the love for the craft.
